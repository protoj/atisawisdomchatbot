# AI Powered Chatbot to communite with Bengali Buddhist Mahapandita Atisa Dipamkara WIP

Create a chatgpt chatbot powered by the lifeworks of Atisa Diikampara using LangChain, Supabase, Typescript, Openai, and Next.js. LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps. Supabase is an open source Postgres database that can store embeddings using a pg vector extension.

And huge shoutout to mayowaoshin's tutorial and base code to help get me started. I'll leave the link to his original work below.
